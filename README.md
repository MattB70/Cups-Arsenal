### Disclaimers
This mod currently supports Forge 1.18.2 and requires geckolib, and has no plans to break from that. This was originally created with my [modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/cups-ultimate-pack) in mind and as such is balanced around a modpack experience, but can just as well be played on its own with its dependencies. Why do I only create for 1.18.2? I personally believe 1.18.2 to be the current best version of Minecraft just as 1.12 was for many years, and 1.8 was before then. I will enjoy playing and creating for it until that changes. It will change, it just hasn't quite yet.

### Bugs, Crashes, Incompatibles, etc.,
Please report all of the above in the issues page on this repo. I do not care if you submit an issue that others may consider spam. It's very easy to keep track of github issues. If you think you have something worth reporting, you likely do, and I ask you to.
